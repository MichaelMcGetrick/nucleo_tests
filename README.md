## <b>Sampling Tests for the  STM32H7S3LR8</b>

This projects tests the integrity of the MCU to provide the required sampling frequency using the on-board timers and ADC controllers.  
i) The project is configured to use USART3 to provide debugging functionality between the device and the host PC.
ii) TIM1 is used as the Timer to periodically take ADC readings at the required sampling rate.
iii) The RTC clock is utilised to flag when the required testing period has been completed.

This example runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [regions 0, 1], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

The USART is configured as follows:

    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time



### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
